I am working on relearning the basics of programming I learned in undergrad and also expanding on that knowledge. I've chosen MIT Open Courseware (OCW) because all my friends that went to MIT know what they are doing. 

I'll loosley follow the MIT compsci degree reqs page (note: the # associated with each course has changed for some)
